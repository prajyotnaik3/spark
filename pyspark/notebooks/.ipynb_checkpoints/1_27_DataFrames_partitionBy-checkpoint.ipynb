    "## PySpark partitionBy() – Write to Disk\n",
    "PySpark partitionBy() is a function of pyspark.sql.DataFrameWriter class which is used to partition the large dataset (DataFrame) into smaller files based on one or multiple columns while writing to disk, let’s see how to use this with Python examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning the data on the file system is a way to improve the performance of the query when dealing with a large dataset in the Data lake. A Data Lake is a centralized repository of structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and binary data that allows you to store a large amount of data as-is in its original raw format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is PySpark Partition?\n",
    "PySpark partition is a way to split a large dataset into smaller datasets based on one or more partition keys. When you create a DataFrame from a file/table, based on certain parameters PySpark creates the DataFrame with a certain number of partitions in memory. This is one of the main advantages of PySpark DataFrame over Pandas DataFrame. Transformations on partitioned data run faster as they execute transformations parallelly for each partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark supports partition in two ways; partition in memory (DataFrame) and partition on the disk (File system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition in memory: You can partition or repartition the DataFrame by calling repartition() or coalesce() transformations.\n",
    "Partition on disk: While writing the PySpark DataFrame back to disk, you can choose how to partition the data based on columns using partitionBy() of pyspark.sql.DataFrameWriter. This is similar to Hives partitions scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partition Advantages\n",
    "As you are aware PySpark is designed to process large datasets with 100x faster than the tradition processing, this wouldn’t have been possible with out partition. Below are some of the advantages using PySpark partitions on memory or on disk.\n",
    "* Fast accessed to the data\n",
    "* Provides the ability to perform an operation on a smaller dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition at rest (disk) is a feature of many databases and data processing frameworks and it is key to make jobs work at scale.\n",
